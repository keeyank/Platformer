# Platformer

This game was created to improve my knowledge in the Unity game development environment.

Inspired by games such as Super Meat Boy and Celeste, I constructed a 2d platformer that utilizes a custom physics engine. Implementation of my own physics engine has given me a better understanding of how physics work in games. 



## Features In-progress:
- Level progression
- Enemies with tracking Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Menu screen 
- Selectable levels 
- Playstation 4 (PS4) controller support


## Features Completed:
- Basic platformer physics ( i.e. gravity, and collision detection)
- Smooth and responsive player controls
- Modular grid based UI for level design
- Wall Jumping
